Tirupati Balaji’s story

Some interesting stories from mythology say that the Lord manifested on the earth to bless the devotees during the age of Kali. Once, Sage Brighu wanted to evaluate who amongst the Holy Trinity was the greatest.  When he checked with Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva, he was not satisfied, so he went to Vaikuntha and kicked Lord Vishnu on his chest. Goddess Lakshmi was residing in the chest of Lord Vishnu, she felt insulted and left Vaikuntha and came down to the Earth.
