The most popular Tirupati Balaji temple on the earth

Notably, Tirupati Balaji temple is the most popular temple on the earth today inviting the maximum number of devotes on any given day and attracting the largest amount of donations from them on a daily basis.

Tirupati Balajiâ€™s story

Some interesting stories from mythology say that the Lord manifested on the earth to bless the devotees during the age of Kali. Once, Sage Brighu wanted to evaluate who amongst the Holy Trinity was the greatest.  When he checked with Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva, he was not satisfied, so he went to Vaikuntha and kicked Lord Vishnu on his chest. Goddess Lakshmi was residing in the chest of Lord Vishnu, she felt insulted and left Vaikuntha and came down to the Earth. <a href="balaji.html" vlink="red"><font color="red"> more..</font></a>
