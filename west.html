<p>Astonishingly carved into hillside rock in the middle of nowhere are the Ajanta and Ellora caves. Both are an important UNESCO World Heritage site.
There are 34 caves at Ellora dating from between the 6th and 11th centuries AD, and 29 caves at Ajanta dating back to between the 2nd century BC and 6th century AD.
The caves at Ajanta are all Buddhist, while the caves at Ellora are a mixture of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain.Funds for the construction of the caves were provided by various rulers.
The incredible Kailasa Temple (also known as the Kailash Temple), which forms Cave 16 at Ellora, is undoubtedly the most famous attraction. 
The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and his sacred abode at Mount Kailash. Its immense size covers twice the area of the Pantheon in Athens, and is one and a half times as high! 
The life-size elephant sculptures are a highlight.The most incomprehensible thing about the Ajanta and Ellora caves is that they were crafted by hand, with only a hammer and chisel.
There are various cave complexes in India, but these are definitely the most spectacular.</p>

<h3>GIR NATIONAL PARK</h3>

<p>Besides Africa, Gir National Park in Gujarat is the only place in the world where you can spot lions roaming free in the wild.
The real discovery channel of India is situated approximately 65 Kms South East of Junagarh District. 
The Government notified the large geographical extent of Sasan Gir as wildlife sanctuary on 18th September, 1965 in order to conserve the Asiatic Lion. 
It covers total area of 1412 square kilometers of which 258 Km forms the core area of the National Park. 
Indiscriminate hunting by the people of Junagarh led to their decrease in population drastically, while they were completely wiped out from the other parts of Asia. 
It was the kind effort of Nawabs of Junagarh who protected the queen royalty in his own private hunting grounds.
Later in due course of time Department of Forest Officials came forward to protect the world’s most threatened species.
From a population of approximately 20 lions in 1913, they have risen to a comfortable 523 according to 2015 census. 
There are 106 male, 201 female and 213 sub-adult lions in the wilderness of these four districts.</p>

<P>The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Mumbai, India. 
The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.
Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. 
The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. 
The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay. It served to allow entry and access to India.
The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chatrapathi Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea.
The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city's top tourist attraction.</p>

The Aravalli Range is a range of mountains running approximately 692 km (430 mi) in a southwest direction, starting in North India from Delhi and passing through southern Haryana, through to Western India across the states of Rajasthan and ending in Gujarat. 
The Aravalli Range has been site of three broad stages of human history, early stone age saw the use of flint stones; mid-stone age starting from 20,000 BP saw the domestication of cattle for agriculture; and post stone age starting from 10,000 BP saw the development of the Kalibangan civilization,
4,000 years old Aahar civilization and 2,800 years old Gneshwar civilization, Aarayan civilization and Vedic era civilizations.
Mining of copper and other metals in the Aravalli range dates back to at least the 5th century BCE, based on carbon dating.
